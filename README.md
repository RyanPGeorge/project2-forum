# THE CONVERSATION: A place to share your thoughts.




Do you:
-------
* have a deep philosophical argument you'd like to debate, but all your friends find you insufferable?
* want to discuss that boring book that only you've been reading lately?
* want to share your terrible and inflammatory political or religious views without annoying or offending people in real life?

# WELL THEN LOOK NO FURTHER MAN

When you join The Conversation, you can:
* see all posts from yourself and other users
* create posts that others can discuss.
* update your post or subject: edit your typos or add a second thought to the discussion!
* delete your posts
* comment on your own posts and other people's posts 
  - deleting and editing comments is a feature that will be added in the future.

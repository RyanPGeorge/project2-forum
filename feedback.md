#### Feedback:  

Nice job all around Ryan. You made an app that had all of the functionality you set out for for even though some things didn't go as planned. I think overall you are on the right track conceptually, you just probably need more practice building and maintaining the client-server architecture which will come with time. 

There are a few things you need to be aware of. For example, you need to apply some CSS styles to the body in order to add either margin, padding or both, to the content page. This will prevent your HTML from running right up against the side of the screen. Also, as we discussed, taking the time to plan everything out will come in handy for data modeling, and beyond. I would like to see some more functionality next time around, however that will come with time. Once you get into the rhythm, then you will be able to do more within given time constraints. Be sure to keep up the practice, and get the hours in where you can. It is crucial that you come out and leave it all out on the field for the next two sections. Keep up the great work, and be sure to reach out if you have any questions.
